abstract: >
  Web access logs contain information on HTTP(S) requests and form a key part of both industry and academic explorations
  of human behaviour on the internet - explorations commonly performed in R. In this paper we explain and demonstrate
  a series of packages - **webreadr**, **urltools**, **iptools** and **rgeolocate** - designed to efficiently read in, parse
  and munge access log data, allowing researchers to handle it easily.

## Introduction

Introductory section which may include references in parentheses
\citep{R}, or cite a reference such as \citet{R} in the text.

## Reading access logs

This section may contain a figure such as Figure \ref{figure:rlogo}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{Rlogo}
  \caption{The logo of R.}
  \label{figure:rlogo}
\end{figure}

## Decoding and parsing URLs

There will likely be several sections, perhaps including code snippets, such as:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```
